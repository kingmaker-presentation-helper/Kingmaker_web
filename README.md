# Kingmaker Web


## Project Introduction

This presentation practice website was designed to assist individuals seeking feedback in their presentation rehearsals.

### Key Features

1. Presentation Recording: Upload recorded files to the server for analysis
2. Question Generation: Generate questions based on the content of the presentation.
4. Speech analysis: Analyze speech speed, filler words, pronunciation accuracy, and emphasized keywords.
5. Gesture Analysis: Analyze presentation gestures to select engaging movements for capturing the audience's attention.
6. Presentation Review: View or save recorded video and transcribed speech.

### Project Inception

Existing presentation rehearsal tools lacked comprehensive feedback features, offering only video recording or basic transcription. To enhance presentation practice efficiency, the goal is to create a tool that not only records and transcribes but also analyzes and provides feedback on the presentation.
